Objective:
The goal in Go Fish is to win the most "books" of cards. A book of cards is any four of
a kind, such as 4 of Kings, 4 of Eights, etc.

How to Play:
The game starts off by dealing the cards. If there are 2 or 3 players in the game, each player gets
7 cards. If there are 4 or 5 players in the game, each player gets 5 cards. The game proceeds in a
cyclical fashion. When it is your turn, you either ask the player next to you for a card
(e.g. Ace of Spades) or draw a card, if you have none. If the  player you asked for a card has the
card you asked for, they hand it over to you, and you get to play your turn again. If the player
doesn't have the card you asked for, they say "Go Fish" and you draw a card from the deck. The play
then proceeds to the next player. If it's your turn and you don't have any cards to play, you draw
a card from the top of the deck. You may ask for a card of that rank, and then the play proceeds to
the next player. If there are no cards left, you are out of the game. Each time a player gets a
four of a kind, it is revealed to the other players. The game ends when all thirteen books have
been won. The player with the most books at the end of the game wins.
